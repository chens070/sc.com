          <h1>Paiwan Gin</h1>
          <p>Paiwan Gin is designed based on my hometown Taiwan, using the traditional snake pattern of a native Taiwanese group- the Paiwan.</p>
          <p>About Paiwan: Traditionally the Paiwan have been polytheists. Their wooden carvings included images of human heads, snakes, deer and geometric patterns.
            In Taiwan, the Bataul branch of the Paiwan tribe holds a major scrifice- called maleveq, every five years to invite the spirits of their ancestors to come and bless them.</p>
          <p> The use of black and gold was inspired by Paiwan's traditional outfit. </p>
          <p>Paiwan Gin is a craft spirit made in Kingdom of fruits-Taiwan with fresh citrus peels and hand-cracked juniper. Our gin is fresh, complex, and flavorful.
            By hand-cutting the citrus fruit and releasing the essential oils in the juniper berries, we made a more vibrant gin than the distillers who use frozen or dried citrus peels.  </p>

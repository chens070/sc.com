        <h1>Unfold</h1>
          <p>Collaboration with <a href="http://dianamejia.co/">Diana Mejia</a>
            and <a href="">Nikhil Misra</a>.
            We are creating a new confrence for the
            new era of designers. The main theme of
            our confrence is increasing diversity in
            the design landscape and the designer’s
            ethical role on diversity.</br>
              We are holding this confrence in Singapore
            because its a model city of growing
            diversity in Asia. Singapore has an
            influence of Chinese, Indian, Malaysian,
            and British culture. It is also a beautiful
            enviroment that promotes growth,
            aesthetics, and design. We would like to
            incorporate multiple languages for our
            design system for the confrence such as
            Mandarin.</br>
              Our Identity reflects diversity in terms of
            color and letterforms, but it also is made to
            be adaptable in many different contexts in
            terms of medium and language. Our goal
            is to make the attendee feel welcomed,
            joyful, and hopeful about a diverse future
            in the design world.</br>
            What we created: Typeface, website, in-conference app, digital signate, posters and collederals.
